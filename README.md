# BimTools

A simple BIM system for Rhinoceros that creates and manages building elements (like walls, floors, columns,..) using structured data.

The main purpose of creating this project is to explore, through hands-on experimentation how BIM logic operates within BIM software like Revit,
and to apply that logic in giving discrete geometric representations meaningful context inside Rhino.

### Requirements

- Rhinoceros 8

## Current Features

- Create simple wall elements in Rhino
- Each element gets a unique ID
- Store metadata on geometry

## Planned Features

- Support for more element types (doors, windows, etc.)
- Convert elements to Revit format
- More advanced tools

## License
